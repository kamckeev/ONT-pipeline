# ONT-pipeline
Pipeline for assembling or rebasecalling raw Oxford nanopore reads

The pipeline is comprised of 8 scripts following 8 steps of genome assembly. Scripts are depositid here on git hub as well as on Dr. Goller's space on NCSU Hazel cluster. The pipeline begins with converting the output of the dorado basecalling in Epi2me into a fastq file.

In general, all user defined variables which may change between different datasets are defined in all caps (ex: OUTPUT_FASTQ_DIR) and later references in the script (ex: "$OUTPUT_FASTQ_DIR"). Users should only change the directory paths to identify their specific dataset at the beginning of the script to avoid creating errors. For ease of use there is a comment line which states "No editing belwo this point". Some software includes variables specific to the software (ex: read depth of data), which the user may wish to alter for their specific dataset.  Specific programs are called in a pixi environment, where each program has a folder within the project folder (wwconsulting).  

## 1_QC_preassembly.sh
 - what it does: Runs Kraken2 to detect and remove contamination using a database. Runs Nanoplot to map read length and quality metrics. Runs KMC to count number of unique k-mers (set to 17 by -k17 in script). Puts all cleaned sequences and diagnostic plots into software specific folders in OUTPUT_DIR.

## 2_trim_reads.sh

- input variables
     - NAME Name of the sample; used to construct output filenames and directories for this trimming step.
          - example value: "SampleB_raw"
     - THREADS Number of threads to use for parallel processing in tools like Porechop and Chopper. Must match #BSUB -n
       - example value: 16

       - example value: 17
     - MIN_LENGTH Minimum read length (in bases) required to keep a read after trimming.
       - example value: 800
     - HEAD Number of bases to trim from the start (5' end) of each read.
       - example value: 10
     - TAIL Number of bases to trim from the end (3' end) of each read.
       - example value: 10
     - PC_THRESH Adapter match threshold used by Porechop to determine whether to trim an adapter; lower values make trimming more permissive. Keep at 90 unless good reason to change, beware of false positives
        -example value: 90.0
